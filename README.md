# üöó Autonomy Platform Integration & Experimentation ‚Äì Case Study

This project documents a specialized integration effort involving retrofitting a vehicle platform with custom autonomy hardware and compute systems. Conducted under a confidentiality agreement, the details here are generalized but reflect real-world responsibilities in system integration, sensor calibration, and experimental validation.

## üîç Overview

As part of an advanced autonomy team, I supported the integration and testing of a new vehicle platform within an autonomous fleet. This involved outfitting the vehicle with custom compute, sensor arrays (LiDAR, radar, cameras), and calibration frameworks distinct from the standard fleet configuration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Responsibilities & Scope

- **Platform Retrofit**  
  Participated in the full retrofit process for a new vehicle model, including mechanical mounts, electrical interfacing, and hardware validation.

- **Sensor Integration**  
  Installed and aligned multi-modal sensors including LiDAR, radar, and vision systems for perception.

- **System Calibration**  
  Ran full calibration workflows across sensor suites, ensuring spatial and temporal sync across compute systems.

- **Scenario Testing & Data Collection**  
  Conducted structured tests across standard and edge-case scenarios to capture telemetry and performance data for downstream autonomy training and system analysis.

- **Fleet Divergence**  
  Supported and maintained a configuration separate from the primary fleet, including unique startup procedures, safety checks, and recovery protocols.
