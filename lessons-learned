# 🧠 Lessons Learned – AV Platform Integration Project

Through this advanced integration project, I gained valuable insights that strengthened my understanding of autonomous system engineering and experimentation. Here's what stood out:

---

## 🔧 Hardware-Software Sync Is Everything

- System reliability depends not only on hardware quality but on **precise alignment, mounting, and calibration**.
- Even small misalignments in sensor placement can result in measurable perception drift or false positives.

---

## ⚙️ Non-Standard Configs = Custom Thinking

- Working with a configuration different from the primary fleet forced me to **think modularly** and **troubleshoot creatively**.
- Standard tooling often needed adaptation — valuable experience in tool customization and operational flexibility.

---

## 📊 Structured Testing Saves Time

- Creating a clear test matrix before deployment made each run efficient and focused.
- Logging tools and scenario planning helped reduce redundant testing and surfaced edge cases faster.

---

## 🤝 Cross-Team Communication = Critical

- Daily collaboration with calibration engineers, safety drivers, and software leads highlighted the importance of **clear, documented communication** in high-stakes environments.

---

## 🔁 Iteration Is the Norm

- Each data run informed the next — calibrations were tuned, sensors re-aligned, and systems refined incrementally.
- Learned how to **work in tight feedback loops** under experimental conditions.

---

## 📁 Takeaway

This experience deepened my ability to work across hardware/software boundaries, operate under strict validation procedures, and deliver high-integrity results in safety-critical systems.
