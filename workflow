# ðŸ”§ AV Integration & Testing Workflow

This document outlines a generalized version of the workflow used to retrofit, calibrate, and validate an autonomous system on a new vehicle platform.

---

## 1. Pre-Integration Planning

- Review vehicle specs, electrical architecture, and sensor mounting points
- Identify compute system placement and ventilation requirements
- Plan unique wiring routes and power requirements

---

## 2. Hardware Installation

- Mount core compute stack (with GPU, interface cards, telemetry, etc.)
- Secure LiDAR, radar, and camera modules with mechanical isolation
- Ensure weatherproofing and secure sensor alignment

---

## 3. System Bring-Up

- Power cycle systems and verify interface recognition
- Run firmware and driver checks for each sensor component
- Perform low-level diagnostics to confirm stability

---

## 4. Sensor Calibration

- Perform intrinsic calibration (camera lens models, radar/laser parameters)
- Run extrinsic calibration to sync sensor positions relative to vehicle frame
- Verify multi-modal sync across perception stack

---

## 5. Scenario Testing

- Deploy test plans covering:
  - Static perception tests
  - Dynamic obstacle tracking
  - Sensor interference cases
  - Recovery protocols
- Collect structured telemetry and video data

---

## 6. Data Review & Iteration

- Analyze data logs using internal tools and cross-functional review
- Adjust parameters or reposition sensors as needed
- Re-run key tests to validate changes

---

## 7. Documentation & Handoff

- Update platform-specific SOPs
- Report system status to relevant stakeholders
- Archive configuration details for future use
